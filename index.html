<h2 class="labels">Summary</h2>
<p>I transitioned into web development after being inspired by a close friend who is a senior developer. With over 10 years of experience in the music industry as a Grammy-nominated and Latin Grammy-winning music producer and songwriter, I've always thrived in creative, detail-oriented, and tech-driven environments. Web development excites me, as it shares many parallels with music production‚Äîboth require organization, focus, and the satisfaction of seeing a project come to life after hours of meticulous work. I'm eager to bring my dedication and technical skills into this new field, whether full-time, part-time, or through freelancing.</p>
